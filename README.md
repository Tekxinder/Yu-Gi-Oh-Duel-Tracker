## Setting Up in OBS Studio

To integrate **YGO Duel Tracker** data into OBS Studio using text files, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Text Files**:
   - Ensure the application saves relevant data (timer, LP, victories) into separate text files (e.g., `timer.txt`, `lp1.txt`, `lp2.txt`).

2. **Create a Text Source in OBS**:
   - Open OBS Studio.
   - Add a new source by clicking the `+` button in the `Sources` section.
   - Select `Text (GDI+)`.

3. **Configure the Text Source**:
   - Name your source (e.g., "Timer").
   - In the text source settings, check `Read from file`.
   - Select the corresponding text file (e.g., `timer.txt`.

4. **Customization**:
   - Customize the text appearance and adjust its position in your OBS scene.

5. **Repeat for Other Data**:
   - Repeat the steps for each piece of data you want to display (LP, victories, etc.).
